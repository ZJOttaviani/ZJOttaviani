## Hello everyone! :grinning:

My name is *Zoe* and I'm having a bit of a play in **GitHub**.

For information about what I do, please see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoe-joanne-green-mcil-cl-0828a996/) and the [Hobbies](https://github.com/ZJOttaviani/ZJOttaviani/edit/main/README.md#hobbies) section.

I love to run in parks like the one below[^1].
